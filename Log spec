Log spec

log should be attached to each set of samples. The actual handling of this is done in config

One log entry completed per run of Expector

log should look like:

Person:_______ Date/Time:_______ 
expecting sample [sample name] in [well location]...
sample [sample name] in [well location]
.
.
.

if complete, 
process complete

if aborted prior to completion
say so

consider:
 - making a log note if a sample was scanned that is not in the sample set
 - making a log note of all samples that were not expected if aborted before process complete.
